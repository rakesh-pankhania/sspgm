Shree Bade Hanumanji is the Devta of Bhakti and Shakti (Power). The purpose of Bhakti (Devotion) is that as Shree Bade Hanumanji 
meditated upon his Aaradhya - Bhagwan Shree Ramchandraji - and throughout his life kept on serving him. Likewise we should also 
learn a lesson from this, that in the path of Bhakti many impediments arrive but the devotee should stick to the path of devotion of 
God and if he has full belief in Omnipotent God, he will be always successful.<p>

The meaning of Shakti (Power) is that in this present Kalyug there are two entities endowed with Shakti, first of them is Shree Bade 
Hanumanji and the second power is Bhagwati Durga Mata. Shree Bade Hanumanji has empowered old age and is immortal. He shall 
remain present even after the end of the universe.<p>
