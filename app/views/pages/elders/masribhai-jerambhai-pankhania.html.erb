  In addition to Bhajans, Painting, etc. Masribhai also had other interests in his young days such as Audio recording, Movie shooting, Drama, etc. He was one of the first persons in Nakuru to have a Movie camera and a Tape recorder (which he had until he came to settle in UK). He took part in a drama “pistol-wala” (Pista-wala) involving Gordhanbhai Chhaya as his Vevai (now real Vevai) and others.<br><br>
  In 1955, Masribhai had the first child named Suresh. 1957 saw the birth of Vasumati and then Vinod in 1960.<br><br>
  In the meantime, he had more companions such as Vasrambhai Ladva, Mohanbhai Chavda, Laljibhai Jagatia, Gordhanbhai Chhaya, Jamnadas Solanki, Devjibhai Vara, Virjibhai Yadav, etc. and Himatbhai Mehta. Also because of Gurupurnima and such annual events at Ram Mandeer, he came in touch with Hirjibapa’s other Sevaks, namely, Maganbhai Bhimjiyani (now Ram-bapa), Ragiji, Bhatbhai, Jivandas Tanna, Damjibhai Pattni, etc. <br><br>
  Later he got more involved with people of his Gnati and did a fair amount of Seva for the Community. Such was his devotion to the Gnati, that Masribhai once fasted for almost a year and a half where he only had fruit and boiled vegetables to get the community members to come together after some rifts.<br><br>
  Apparently, there was another instance when Masribhai went on a fast for 15 days eating absolutely nothing but water and milk. Hirjibapa ordered him to break this fast. As said a lot was done for unity of various people and the Gnati.<br><br>
  Whenever big programs were organised by Hirjibapa’s Bhajan Mandali, various members would dress up in ‘Vesh-bhusa’. Here Masribhai would always dress up as Hanumanji, his eternal master. Once when building a roof at Ram Mandeer, having a huge fist he tested the strength of the roof by hitting it. The result was the roof collapsing and he falling to the floor with damages to his knee. Since then he stopped dressing as Hanumanji, apparently on Hirjibapa’s request.<br><br>
  Speaking of strength, it is also true that when waking up in the morning, having done his ‘Daatan’ Masribhai would often do wrestling with Jerambhai (son of Bapa). Also, in those days, due to his heavy hand, people were often afraid of giving him their hand for ‘Tali’.<br><br>
  In terms of work things weren’t going too well for Masribhai and he experienced major financial problems at that stage of his life. He did not have much spare cash even to send to his mother and family in India. However, in 1964 for the first time after 20 years, he returned to India by Steamer to see his mother Manuben. Due to financial circumstances, this trip was not an easy one. Having arrived in India he met his mother and brother Devjibhai and stayed in India for 2 or 3 months and then returned to his family in Kenya by Steamer.<br><br>
  After his return from India, in 1965 Urvashi was born and in the same year Masribhai set up a new workshop “Ruby Body Builders” which was later known as “Boat Builders” which was to be a great success. Urvashi’s birth was like a blessing and brought good luck. Or this was possibly a blessing from his mother whom he saw after 20 years. Boat Builders started to run very well. Boat building was not the main business; Furniture making and Building contracting became more part of the Business as time went on. Masribhai, with Vinod at his side in the final few years, has constructed lots of Buildings in and around Nakuru, including Warehouses, Schools, etc.<br><br>
  In good times and bad times, Masribhai continued his religious lifestyle and carried on with Gnati Seva. He became vice-president of SSPGM Nakuru and did a lot for the community. With his contribution, SSPGM Nakuru organised seven major Mahotsavs including the ‘Bhagvad Mahotsav’ attended by Gnati members from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. At this time he also created “Sri-Bai” visa (as Hanuman chalisa, but with 20 chopais) and helped Mohanbhai Fatania in the production of “Sri-Bai Sant Sarita” (a collection of Sri-Bai and other Prajapati Bhagto & Santo Charitra).<br><br>
  About this time, he came in touch with Sri Pragjibhai Ladva, who used to attend the annual Gurupurnima programmes in Nakuru. They have been very close since then and have been to lots of events together including 3 trips to Morogoro in Tanzania. One of these trips was to attend the Bhagvat Saptah organised by his uncle Pitamberbhai.<br><br>
  In 1967 Masribhai called his brother Devjibhai from and then in 1971 his mother to stay in Nakuru. His mother then lived in Nakuru for the rest of her life, staying at Masribhai and Devjibhai’s houses.<br><br>
  In 1972, with the blessing of Hirjibapa, Masribhai after obtaining a large plot of land decided to build his own house. On this site he built a two-storey house containing 7-8 bedrooms. He also built the front line of shops including ‘Lima’.<br><br>
  Having moved away from the Ram Mandeer meant that he had to travel to the Mandeer everyday to carry out his Seva and other daily rituals as carried out before. Going to the Mandeer and reading the Ramayan was a daily essential for Masribhai and was carried out almost to his last day in Nakuru.<br><br>
  In 1974, for the first time, Masribhai with Pragjibhai and other Sevaks accompanied Sant Shri Hirjibapa on his first trip to the UK. He stayed with Bapa throughout the trip. Many padhramanis were made and Guru Purnima was also celebrated in Bapa’s presence.<br><br>
  During this trip, as a daily routine Bapa would narrate the Ramayan satsang. But one day Bapa was feeling unwell and he sat quietly and looked at Masribhai and said, “Masri, can you read and explain the Ramayan today for I am unwell. From this day onward I expect you to carry out the Ramayan sermons during my life time and after I’m gone to carry it on a daily basis, as I will speak less”. For Masribhai this was the biggest Ashirvad given to him by Bapa and even today that Adesh given by his guru is being carried out in the form of Satsang and Ramayan reading everyday.<br><br>
  Having returned to Kenya after the trip to UK, Masribhai had to come to the UK a second time within a few months in 1974 for the wedding of his daughter, Vasumati to Bhagwanji Chhaya. Within a year Masribhai became a grandfather (Nanabapa) with the arrival of daughter Hasmita to Vasumati.<br><br>
  In January 1976 Masribhai’s guru Sant Hirjibapa passed away and this was a very sad part in his life. The next year, on invitation from Maganbhai Bhimjiyani, He came to the UK again with Pragjibhai Ladva and Pujya Hirama, to attend a nine day Ramayan Parayan by Sri Indubhushan Goswami from India. Here he also met Uma Bharti who said Masribhai should be called Mercybhai (kind brother).<br><br>
  After the eldest son Suresh’s marriage to Nalita (from Birmingham) in 1978, a Bhagvat Saptah was organised by Masribhai in Southall in 1979. This was in remembrance of his late father Jerambhai and was carried out successfully and enjoyed thoroughly. This was probably one of the first Saptah in this country.<br><br>
  1981 saw the arrival of the first grandson Rohit to Nalita and Suresh.<br><br>
  In 1982/83 Masribhai went to India (first or second time with Mandoobhai Gohil) and also visited North India first time with Muktaben, Suresh and Nalita. This was the start of his annual trips to India with Mandoobhai.<br><br>
  In 1983 Masribhai came to the UK where Vinod got married to Veena.<br><br>
  In 1984 Masribhai went to Uganda for the first time. It’s surroundings and state was bad. Here he had plans to set up small jobs especially for the benefit of Immigrants from India. Economically, the situation was very bad, so this trip was not very successful.<br><br>
  Around this time, Masribhai organised a 2 or 3 days Pankhania Samelan in Nakuru at his house. This was attended by Pankhanias from as far as Mombasa and was a great success. Masribhai has always been proud of Pankhanias (he always says “Amara” Pankhania).<br><br>
  In 1985 Masribhai came to the UK for his last child Urvashi’s wedding to Amratlal Chandegra.<br><br>
  1986 saw the birth of two grandsons Dhruv and Harshad. In 1989 two granddaughters Bhakti and Meera were born in the UK.<br><br>
  In 1989, the Ram-Mandeer was refurbished and was made a lot bigger. Murtis were to replace the existing photos. As a sevak, Masribhai was busy with this for a long period of time. Masribhai saw what was his original home or house change and today we can see a very well known Ram-Mandeer in Nakuru.<br><br>
  After a long time (6 or 7 years), in 1992 July Masribhai and Muktaben came to the UK together, especially to see the grandchildren. He had however visited India almost every year.<br><br>
  Again in 1994 they returned this time visiting both Suresh and Vinod who had moved here permanently. This time Masribhai also visited America where he stayed with Mohanlal Virji Fatania in Atlanta. Whilst, in America, he gave his first Ramayan Pravachan at Dhiru Zina and Shila Pankhania's home and then almost daily at different houses.   In October this year, whilst still here, Masribhai’s mother Manuben passed away in Kenya. This was a huge loss and the couple returned back to Kenya.<br><br>
  1995 saw another visit to the UK with many events happening here. There was the wedding of Kishor and Meena as well a Saptah held by Devjibhai. This was enjoyed a lot. A month after the Saptah a Navan Parayan was arranged by Suresh. This was the first Parayan where Masribhai was present with all the family together.<br><br>
  Also this year after returning to Kenya, Masribhai went to India where most Sitaram Group members to visit the various Hanuman Temples in Gujrat joined him.<br><br>
  Masribhai and Muktaben visited the UK and India again in 1996, 1997 and 1998. On departure back in 1998 Masribhai promised that the next arrival back to the UK would be the final one and he would settle here for good and give up the running around. They were accompanied by Rohit due to a Barpahoro Path in Nairobi that was to be attended by Shernath Bapu of Junagadh.<br><br>
  In 1998/1999 both sons Vinod and then Suresh made individual journeys to visit Kenya for the final time whilst Masribhai was still there.
  Finally in March 1999 Masribhai and Muktaben left Nakuru (Kenya) for good and arrived in the UK to settle here in Milton Keynes with Vinod. He left behind 55 years of happy living and these quality memories will remain with him for the rest of his life. He left behind many friends whom he saw everyday including Mandoobhai and Babubhai.<br><br>
  After settling in UK in 1999, a Navan Parayan was arranged by Vinod. This was the first Parayan at his new home. Then Masribhai visited America 2nd time where he stayed with Mohanlal Virji Fatania in Atlanta. This time he gave the Ramayan Pravachan at  Arun Mohanlal Fatania's new home. In presence of many congregation members. <br><br>
  In 2000 a Bhagvat Saptah was organised by Masribhai in Southall Gnati Nivas. This was attended by many people including from overseas, especially Rajubhai Shastri, Shernath Bapu, Muldas Bapu, brother from Kenya and sister from India as well as others like Mohanlal Fatania & his daughter Shila Dhiru Pankhania from USA, Narshibhai Dhokia from Canada, etc. This programme was carried out very successfully and enjoyed thoroughly by everyone.<br><br>
  At the end of 2000 Masribhai visited South India for the first time with Muktaben, Vinod and family. He liked Rameshwara and Kanyakumari (Vivekanand Memorial) very much. Later he also visited the “Maha Kumbh Mela” at Allahabad with Purshotambhai Jagatia. This was one of the major events in India.<br><br>
  In 2001 a 75-Hour Dhoon programme was organised by the family of Masribhai to celebrate his (approximate) 75th birthday.<br><br>
  Today here in the UK he attends Sundarkaand path, Hanuman chalisa, etc. with Sitaram Group as well as Ram-Bapa’s Mandal wherever it maybe and such chaupais are always on his lips.<br><br>
  Through the guidance of Hirjibapa, Masribhai has devoted his life to Ramayan prachar and spreading the word of god through religious discourses i.e. Satsang. Masribhai as mentioned made it a daily essential whilst in Nakuru to go to Ram Mandeer everyday and to do Ramayan and Satsang according to Bapa’s orders.<br><br>
  Hanumanji especially has taken a big seat in Masribhai’s heart and has fascinated his principles and Masribhai sees him as the main uplifter of Ram nam smaran. He always stresses that all should pray to him whom without this world would turn to chaos. Masribhai’s Satsang are often taken towards Hanumanji’s life as well as the life of great Mahatmas and saints including Gandhiji, Hirjibapa, etc.<br><br>
  As mentioned Masribhai has also done a lot for the Gnati. He has accompanied Mandoobhai on countless occasions to Bharat for Gnati work and has helped him wherever possible on an advisory level.<br><br>
  Masribhai has earned himself a very big name and is famous for his discourses given on the Ramayan. Thus during his stay in Nakuru, Masribhai had made quite a lot of friends and a strong bond was created between them. While in Nakuru, He also entertained Sadhu-Santo such as Uma Bharti, Lakhabhai Gadhvi, Satpalji Maharaj, Gargibai, HareshwariBen, Shernath Bapu and various others.<br><br>
