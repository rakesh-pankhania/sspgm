Jai Shree Bai Mataji<p>

It gives me great pleasure to thank all the members of Shree Sorathia
Prajapati Gnati Mandal of Atlanta for electing me as the President and
giving me this opportunity to serve our community.  Since moving to the
United States in 1994, I have had the opportunity to serve our
community in
various postions in the executive committee.  However, this postion is
a
special one.  Special, not because it is a prestigious one but special
because it is challenging, demanding, and delicate.  It offers me an
opportunity to promote peace and harmony, and preserve our culture and
religion within our community.<p>

Through the SSPGM website, I would like to take this opportunity to
convey
my regards and best wishes to all the members of Shree Sorathia
Prajapati
Gnati Mandals world wide.<p>
