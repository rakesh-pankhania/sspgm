<p>The family tree states the following from "History of Fatania Kul/Family" as per our Barot's records.<p>

<p>
  In the year 1046 Bardai Brahmin, Naranji Gor's two sons, namely Odhavaji and Kanji filled a Kavad
  with water (i.e. two pots filled with water, attached by rope on the ends of a supporting wooden
  rod) which is then carried on a shoulder. The two brothers started to go on a yatra to Dwarka, to
  bathe Thakurji in Gomati.
</p>

<p>
  On the way, they came to a village called Fatana (A village in Mount Barda in Porbander State).
  Here they went to a house of a Gujar-Sutar (Carpenter) whose name was Velji and his surname
  (Shankh) was Parmar. At Velji Parmar's house, they drank water from his water pot.
</p>

<p>
  As both the brothers, were Brahmin, and as they drank water from Gujar Sutar's home, they were
  both considered impured (In Gujarati Vatlela) Brahmins.
</p>

<p>
  The Bardai Brahmin community made them outcast because they were Vatlela. After this, Odhavaji
  and Kanji, came back to the village Fatana and married two of Velji Gujar's daughters. As Gujar
  Sutar is being Prajapati Kumbhar both, Odhavji and Kanji became Kumbhar. And as they were living
  in Fatana village, they became known as Fatania.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, since then, Odhavji and Kanji, being Brahmin became known as Prajapati Kumbhar and
  their surname (Shankh) given as Fatania.
</p>

<p>
  The root of Fatania family started this way from Bardai Brahmin of Fatana to present caste
  Kumbhar community.
